An open source electric vehicle supply equipment(EVSE), built for simplicity and functionality

## Why?
This project is a simple light EVSE designed to safely charge an electric vehicle while providing
necessary data reading, monitoring and viewing on a dashboard. 

It implements the necessary safety features, not as much as for a professional device, but enough to 
see a charging process through. 

It is built for functionality, experiment and usage by any one interested in the EV supply equipment.

I built it as part of a learning project. You are welcome to contribute.
